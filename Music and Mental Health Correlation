This project explores the connection between music listening habits and mental health, focusing on anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. Using survey responses from 736 participants, we analyzed how factors like favorite genres, listening hours, and streaming platforms relate to mental well-being. The data was collected from Reddit, Discord, and social media platforms, offering a diverse but potentially skewed sample.

After preparing the data by converting listening frequencies into numerical values and handling missing entries, we computed correlations and visualized them in a heatmap. The results revealed weak but interesting trends such as a slight positive correlation between listening hours and insomnia or anxiety. Certain genres, like Metal and Rock, showed minor links to mental health metrics, while anxiety and depression had a stronger correlation with each other.

While the dataset isn’t strong enough for definitive conclusions, it provides a solid foundation for exploring how music impacts mental health. This repository includes the dataset, R script, and heatmap, making replicating or building on this work easy. It’s a small but meaningful step in understanding the relationship between music and mental well-being.
