The analysis of depression rates across different marital statuses reveals significant patterns. Widowed individuals exhibit the highest depression rate at 50%, highlighting the emotional impact of losing a spouse. Married and divorced individuals show similar depression rates of approximately 22.85% and 22.73%, respectively, suggesting that marriage does not necessarily serve as a protective factor against depression. In comparison, single individuals experience the lowest depression rate at 20.15%, which may indicate fewer relationship-related stressors. These results suggest that while marital status influences depression risk, there are other factors such as grief, emotional support, and individual circumstances likely play a crucial role in mental well-being.
