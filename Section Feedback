What was the most useful feedback that your group received?

One of the teams mentioned how we should add a resource page to our website. Since our website is on mental health and depression it's good to add informational pages.
Also to centralize the texts and information into a tab or different page to make it more user friendly and accessible.

Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?

I think I will research more on about my topic on depression and marriage (based on my data set). And create a page about my findings and information I have collected.

Focusing on the other group projects that you saw in class, what is one technique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?

We maybe want to add stakeholders into our research problem. Or determine the who, what, when , where, and how.
