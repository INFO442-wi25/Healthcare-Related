1/29/2025 Critique reflection:
1. I think it was helpful hearing their feedback about narrowing our scope and reevaluating who we want our website to target
2. I will try to focus our findings and interpretations towards a common theme, and make sure that we check in with each other about our visualizations so that there is a clear connection between them.
3. I think using Azure more would be fun because I don't have as much experience with it (compared to code).
