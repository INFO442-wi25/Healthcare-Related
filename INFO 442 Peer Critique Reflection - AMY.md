* What was the most useful feedback that your group received?  
  * The most useful feedback we received was in relation to how we were going to structure our website. Our partner group suggested that we put all of our visualization descriptions together on a separate page of our website and the visualizations on the home page. I think it was good feedback because it helps us ensure that our site is user friendly and ultimately lets users learn from the data itself rather than words.  
* Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?  
  * I will make sure to enhance my visualization because right now it is not that interactive so users wouldn’t learn that much information from it. Also I need to make sure that my descriptions/overall text is minimal so that it doesn’t overcomplicate/confuse the user.   
* Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class, what is one technique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?  
  * I want to try Azure DevOps. The other team that critiqued us used Azure for the majority of their project and their project organization seemed very organized and well structured. I’ve used it before but it has been roughly an entire year since I last used it and I want to figure out how to apply it to this project.
